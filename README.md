# categoryType
A category or factor data type for C++

## Introduction and Overview
  
  Neither base C++ not the current template libraries contain a categorical data type, and essential type for data analysis represented by the dummy variable of linear regression models. R has the factor type for this.
  
  This C++ category type is intended to fill this need, with the data type definition and the associated methods and classes required to manipulate categorical data in the same environment as integer, double and string data. double must be converted to integer type in order to be categorize. String based, qualitative, representations of observations must be ranked to be analyzed with other data.
